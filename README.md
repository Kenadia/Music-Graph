All code by Ken Schiller.

This program uses features that were gathered from the sheet music and from the recording of an orchestra performance of Antonio Vivaldi's “L'Inverno”, from The Four Seasons, to generate a visual representation of the music. With time on the x-axis, the graph shows all the notes hit by each of the five parts as well as changes in loudness.
